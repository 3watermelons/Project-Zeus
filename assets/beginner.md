**Referral Benefit:**  If you have a referral code, you start at level 1 instead of 0! 🚀

Note: Once registered, there is no need to sign in again; we track using your number.

## ⭐Daily Check-In⭐


### What are check-ins?

Check-ins involve consistently logging your daily habits , whether or not you complete them. This continuous tracking helps maintain your streak and supports your progress toward your goals. 🔢

### How do you level-up?

Each check-in increases your level by 1. Missing a day resets your level to 1. Logging your habits is crucial, even if you can’t complete them. If you missed any of your habits, simply mark it with a cross instead of a tick; this won’t affect your streak.

### How to checkin?
#### send a msg in the below format on the tracker group

**Example Check-In:**

```yaml
checkin
sleep: ❌ 3-10
avoid junk: ❌ icecream
exercise: ✅ swimming
learn: ✅ read 10 pages
```

Let us understand this user's checkin

1.  **Sleep**: ❌ 3-10 - Did not sleep on time hence cross
2.  **Avoid Junk**: ❌ icecream- Ate junk food hence cross
3.  **Exercise**: ✅ (swimming) - Exercised hence tick
4.  **Learn**: ✅ (read 10 pages) - Completed learning hence tick

**Flexible:**  fitness can be 1 hr ab workout at the gym or even 5 pushups.

## Referral Benefits

### Level Boost

When your friend registers using your referral code, both of you receive a level boost. This benefit can be utilized only once per week, with any additional referrals accumulating for subsequent weeks.

While motivating others is great, our focus is on self-improvement through consistent check-ins. 💪
